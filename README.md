# Ax’s Portfolio

A personal developer portfolio built with Django, designed to showcase my coding projects, experience, and personality. This site blends professionalism with a touch of who I am — an organised, methodical full-stack developer with a background in criminology, catering, and a lifelong love of heavy music. The goal is simple: present my work clearly, confidently, and authentically.

## 6. Deployment (Heroku)

This section outlines the full process for deploying Ax’s Portfolio from GitHub to a local development environment using VS Code, and then hosting the application live on Heroku with a production PostgreSQL database provided by Neon.

### 6.1 Clone the Repository

- Navigate to GitHub and click the “+” icon to create a new repository
- Enter a repository name and optional description
- Choose Public or Private
- Do not initialise with a README, .gitignore, or license
- Click Create repository

### 6.2 Clone the Repository to VS Code

- Open VS Code and access the integrated terminal
- Navigate to the directory where the project will live
- Copy the repository URL from GitHub
- Use Clone Git Repository in VS Code or clone via terminal
- Open the cloned project folder in VS Code

### 6.3 Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

- Create a virtual environment inside the project root
- Activate the environment according to your operating system
- Confirm activation by checking that the environment name appears in the terminal prompt
- This isolates project dependencies and prevents conflicts with system-wide packages.

## 6.4 Install Project Dependencies

- Install all required packages using the requirements.txt file
- Key dependencies include:
- Django – Backend web framework
- Gunicorn – WSGI server required by Heroku
- dj-database-url – Parses the database URL into Django settings
- psycopg2-binary – PostgreSQL database adapter
- WhiteNoise – Static file handling in production
- If requirements.txt does not yet exist, install dependencies manually and generate it before continuing.

### 6.5 Prepare the Project for Heroku

- Create a Procfile at the project root containing: `web: gunicorn config.wsgi`
- Ensure gunicorn, dj-database-url, and psycopg2-binary are installed
- Confirm static file settings and WhiteNoise configuration
- Commit all changes to GitHub

### 6.6 Set Up a Heroku Account and CLI

- Create an account at Heroku.com
- Download and install the Heroku CLI for your operating system
- Log in via the CLI to authenticate your local environment

### 6.7 Create a Heroku App

- Use the Heroku CLI or dashboard to create a new app
- Assign a unique app name
- Heroku will automatically generate a remote Git endpoint

### 6.8 Configure Environment Variables on Heroku

- Open the app in the Heroku Dashboard
- Navigate to Settings → Reveal Config Vars
- Add the following environment variables:
- DEBUG = False
- SECRET_KEY = Django secret key
- DATABASE_URL = Neon PostgreSQL connection string
- ALLOWED_HOSTS = Heroku app domain
- CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = Heroku app URL
- Sensitive values are stored securely and are not committed to version control.

### 6.9 Configure a Custom Domain on Heroku

This project is configured to use a custom domain (axdeklerk.co.uk) instead of the default Heroku subdomain.

- Add the Custom Domain in Heroku
- Open the application in the Heroku Dashboard
- Navigate to Settings → Domains
- Click Add domain
- Enter the custom domain: `axdeklerk.co.uk`
- Heroku will generate a DNS target (DNS record value)

#### 6.9.1 Update DNS Records at the Domain Provider

- Log in to the domain registrar or DNS provider managing axdeklerk.co.uk
- Create or update a CNAME or ALIAS/ANAME record (depending on provider support)
- Point the domain to the DNS target provided by Heroku
- Remove any conflicting A records that may override the custom domain
- DNS propagation may take several minutes to several hours to complete.

#### 6.9.2 Verify Domain Configuration

- Return to the Heroku Domains section
- Confirm the custom domain shows as active
- Visit [https://axdeklerk.co.uk](https://axdeklerk.co.uk) in a browser to verify successful routing

#### 6.9.3 Enable HTTPS (Automatic)

- Heroku automatically provisions SSL certificates for verified custom domains
- HTTPS is enabled once DNS propagation completes
- No manual certificate configuration is required

### 6.10 Push the Project to Heroku

- Ensure the Heroku remote is connected to the local repository
- Push the project code to Heroku
- Heroku will automatically install dependencies and build the application

### 6.11 Final Project Setup on Heroku

- Run database migrations using the Heroku CLI
- Create a Django superuser for admin access
- Confirm static files are collected and served correctly
- Verify the site loads correctly via the custom domain

### 6.11 Open the Live Site

- Open the deployed application using: `https://axdeklerk.co.uk`
- Confirm navigation, static assets, and database-backed content load correctly

### 6.12 Summary

Deployment was successful, with the application running stably under a custom domain using DEBUG=False. HTTPS is enabled, static files are served correctly, and the site behaves consistently in production.
